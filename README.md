  ## Installation
  - In order to run the app, the user should clone this repository to their local device then run npm init followed by npm install in the integrated command line from the root of the directory.  That will set up the proper package.json file and install the necessary packages.
  ## Usage
  - This application helps the user to digitally store and save notes by entering a note title and note content.  The user can then refer to each note in the saved notes column by referencing the each note's title.  The user may also edit and delete notes from the same list. Once the proper packages are installed, the user may start the app by running node server from the integrated command line and opening the browser to localhost:3001.
  ## Contributing
  - Developers are welcome to contribute to this project by cloning this GitHub repository to their local device.  One potential area of expansion is to further deconstruct the apiRoutes into separate modular files beyond the index.js where all api routes are currently housed.
  ## Tests
  - Currently no tests are available or required to run the application.
